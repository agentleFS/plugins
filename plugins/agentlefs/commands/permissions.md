Report what **this credential** effectively reaches in agentleFS. Nothing more. This is a self-audit of the current principal's reach, not a report on anyone else's access.

Argument: `$ARGUMENTS` (optional folder to focus on).

## Step 1 - the reachable set

Call `mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__list_org_folders` with no arguments. What comes back is the complete set of folders this principal reaches. A folder absent from that list is either not granted to this principal or does not exist, and the two are indistinguishable by design.

If the list is empty, stop and say so: this credential reaches no folders. Likely no organization membership or no grants yet. Send them to `/agentlefs:connect`. Do not report "the organization has no content."

## Step 2 - per-folder shape

If `$ARGUMENTS` names a folder, call `mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__list_org_folders` with that folder and report only it.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, orient across everything: call `mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__list_org_folders` once per reachable folder to collect each folder's shape. Cap this at roughly the first 10 folders when there are many, and say plainly that you capped it and which folders you skipped.

Each per-folder call returns: how many files you can read, how many are `denied` (gated from you), a breakdown by type, and the labels present.

## Step 3 - report

Lead with a table, not prose:

| Folder | Readable | Gated | Types | Labels |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Then add, in a few lines:

- Total readable files across the folders you checked, and total gated.
- Any folder where the gated count dominates the readable count. That is the most useful signal in the whole report: it means substantial content sits next to what you can see, and you would never encounter it through search.
- Any folder that is fully readable with zero gated files.

## What you must state

Include this, in your own words, every time:

> Denied is byte-identical to not-found. A gated file is invisible, not marked. Where a `denied` count appears it tells you how many files are gated, never which ones or what they are about. Where a listing looks thin, "gated from you" and "does not exist" cannot be distinguished from here.

Also state that labels carry zero authority. They organize content and nothing else. An unlabeled file is not public, and a sensitively-labeled file is not thereby restricted. Access comes only from explicit grants.

## What you must NOT do

- **Do not claim to enumerate anyone else's access.** There is no MCP tool that returns grants. For "who else can see this", route to `/agentlefs:who-can-see`, which deep-links the console.
- **Do not call a console API endpoint.** The console API accepts a Clerk browser session JWT only; this credential would 401.
- **Do not infer a grant from a label, a filename, or a folder name.**
- **Do not describe a thin result as evidence that content does not exist.**
- Do not present the reachable set as the organization's full inventory. It is this principal's view of it.

## If a call errors

The read path is fail-closed on purpose. A truncated allow-set throws rather than quietly returning a subset, so an error is the system refusing to under-report. Surface the error verbatim and do not substitute a partial summary for a complete one.

For the model behind all of this, the `authorization-model` skill has the full picture.
