Help the user share `$1` with someone. Your job is to get the decision right and show its blast radius **before** they click. The grant itself happens in the console, because this credential cannot mutate grants.

Target: `$1` (a `location` — a full path from the workspace root, naming either a folder like `product` or a single document like `product/runbooks/deploy.md`). If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, call `mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__list_org_folders` with no arguments, show the reachable folders, and ask which one they mean.

## Step 1 - orient on what the recipient would get

Do this first. Sharing decisions go wrong because the sharer does not know how much is under the thing they are sharing.

- For a folder: call `mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__list_org_folders` with that folder. Report how many files are there, the type breakdown, and the labels.
- For a single document: call `mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__list_org_docs` with the document's `location` to confirm it exists and is the intended file.

Then state the blast radius explicitly: **grants cascade down the folder tree.** A grant on a folder reaches every descendant of that folder, including subdirectories and files added later. A grant scoped to one document reaches only that document.

Say the number out loud. "Sharing `engineering/` at view gives them all 240 files under it, including anything added tomorrow" is the sentence that prevents the mistake.

One caveat to state honestly: the counts you can see are **your** counts. If the folder holds files gated from you, the total is larger than what you reported. Say so rather than presenting your view as the complete inventory.

## Step 2 - choose the role

Three roles are offered outward. The console labels them view / edit / manage.

| Console label | Role | Grants | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| view | `reader` | read and search the content | the default; the recipient needs to know, not change |
| edit | `writer` | read plus write and edit documents | the recipient maintains the content |
| manage | `owner` | ownership of the scope, and satisfies the writer bar | the recipient is accountable for it |

Guidance to give:

- Default to view. Escalate only on a stated need.
- **One ladder: `reader` < `writer` < `owner`.** Each rung contains the one below it, so an owner reads and writes everything at or below what it owns, and additionally grants and revokes there. Treat manage as "accountable for it, and can change it".
- The ladder is stated once, in `openfga/model.fga`, and there is no app-layer fold — asking the engine for `writer` already returns allow for an owner, so the console and MCP cannot give different answers. This guidance used to say `owner ⇏ writer` and that the authority layer folded it; that was the pre-#219 model.
- There are three roles and no others. `proposer` and `member` are retired, and neither was ever granted to anyone.

Pick the narrowest scope that does the job. A document-scoped grant is almost always safer than a folder-scoped one, and re-sharing a second document later is cheap.

## Step 3 - hand off to the console

You cannot perform the grant. There is no MCP tool that creates, modifies, or reads grants, and the console API authenticates with a Clerk browser session JWT that a CLI credential does not hold. Never attempt an API call here.

Give the user the deep link and name the screen:

- Open `https://agentlefs.com`, navigate to the folder or file, and open the **Share panel**.
- Enter the recipient's email and pick view, edit, or manage.
- For time-boxed outside access, the same panel offers a **7-day share link**.
- To share with a group rather than a person, use **Groups**. Group membership nests, so a grant to a group reaches its nested member groups too.
- After sharing, the **"Shared with"** list on that folder or file confirms it, and marks each entry granted-here versus inherited from an ancestor.

Then present a one-line summary they can act on, for example: "Share `engineering/runbooks` with dana@example.com at view (reader). 41 files, cascades to all descendants."

## What you must state

- Grants cascade to descendants, including files created later.
- **Denied is byte-identical to not-found.** Before the grant, the recipient cannot tell this content is gated from them; it looks like it does not exist. After the grant, it appears. That transition is the entire observable effect of sharing.
- Labels carry zero authority. Sharing is not affected by labels, and no label restricts anything.

## What you must NOT do

- **Do not claim you shared anything.** You prepared the decision; the human performs it.
- Do not call any console API endpoint.
- Do not guess a recipient's email address. Ask.
- Do not describe a label or a filename as if it controlled access.
