description: How to delete something from agentleFS without destroying more than intended. Use whenever a deletion is on the table — removing a document, clearing out a directory, deleting a folder, cleaning up after a migration or a bad ingest — and before calling mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__delete_org_doc for any reason. Also use to explain why a delete was refused, or why deletion needs two calls.

# Deleting from agentleFS

Deletion is the one mutation with no inverse. A write leaves the previous version in
history and a rename relocates something that still exists; a delete ends the object.
The store is built so this is recoverable by an operator, but nothing in your session
can undo it.

So the rule for this skill is one sentence: **you find out what would be destroyed,
a human decides, and only then do you delete.**

## The tool makes you do it in two calls

`mcp__plugin_agentlefs_agentlefs__delete_org_doc` will not delete on a first call. Call it without
`confirm_token` and it deletes nothing — it returns what *would* go, plus a token:

```
⚠ NOT DELETED YET — this is what would happen.

Target: the entire folder engineering
Files removed: 240
  e.g. onboarding.md, runbooks/deploy.md, adr/0003-folders.md
  …and 232 more not listed here (beyond this sample, or owned by you without a read grant)
Connector: syncs from the GitHub repository acme/platform — deleting the folder stops that sync.
Reach grants on this folder are revoked with it.
```

This is not a formality to route around. It is the sentence that prevents the
mistake, and it is addressed to a person, not to you.

## What to do with it

1. **Call once without `confirm_token`.** Never guess a token, never reuse one from
   earlier in the conversation.
2. **Show the person what came back** — in your own words is fine, but the file
   count, the connector, and the "you cannot see" number must survive the retelling.
   Those three are the whole decision.
3. **Ask, and wait for an answer.** A real question with a real pause. "I'll go ahead
   unless you object" is not asking.
4. **Only then call again with the token.**

**Never spend a token the same person did not just approve.** If you were asked to
"clean up the old folders" and you are three deletes into a list, each one still gets
its own preview and its own answer. Bulk permission is the thing this skill exists to
prevent — the second delete is where the surprise lives.

If they say no, say what you did not delete and stop. Do not offer a narrower delete
unless they ask; the answer to "should this be gone" was no.

## Read the preview properly

- **The file count includes files you cannot see.** If the target holds content
  gated from you, the number is still the true number — the gate counts every file
  at HEAD. That is why a preview can say 240 when you can list 237.
- **The "not listed" number is not an alarm.** Owning a folder does not by itself
  grant you read access to what is in it, so the commonest caller — an admin who
  owns the folder — sees a small sample and a large remainder. That means "you own
  these and hold no read grant", not "these are hidden from you".
- **The sample is exact, never approximate.** Every path named is a path that will
  actually go. A file that merely shares the prefix — `reports-archive/` when you
  named `reports`, or `open.md.bak` when you named `open.md` — is not in the blast
  radius and will not appear.
- **A connector line changes the decision.** If the folder mirrors a GitHub repo or
  a Drive folder, deleting it here stops that sync. The upstream content survives;
  the organization's access to it through agentleFS does not. Say this out loud —
  people delete folders thinking they are tidying a copy.
- **Reach grants go with a folder.** Everyone who could reach it loses that, and the
  grants do not come back if the folder is later recreated under the same name.

## When it refuses

| What you see | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `denied: 'delete_file' not permitted for roles [...]` | Deletion needs the **admin** console role. Most agent credentials do not have it, by design. | Stop. A human deletes this in the console. Do not look for another route. |
| `not permitted: N files here can't be deleted with your access` | You are admin but you do not **own** every affected file. Deletion is all-or-nothing on purpose — a partial delete is the worst outcome available. | Report which files blocked it. The named ones are ones you can read; any remainder is counted, not named, and you cannot find out what they are. |
| `this folder changed since that confirmation was issued` | Someone wrote to the folder between your preview and your confirm, so the numbers the person approved are stale. | Re-preview, show the person what changed, ask again. Do not re-confirm on the old answer. |
| `that confirmation has expired` | More than ten minutes passed. | Re-preview. If the delay was because the person is still deciding, that is the system working. |

## What you cannot do from here

There is no undelete tool, and no tool that lists what was deleted. Restoring a
folder means an operator re-inserting its ref at the commit named in the delete
response — so **keep that commit hash in your reply**. It is the only thing standing
between a mistaken delete and a support conversation.

You also cannot delete `.permissions.json`, and you cannot delete a file a connector
mirrors — that content is a mirror, and the next sync would bring it back anyway.
Change it at the source.
